Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no Money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on Monday, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the time. It is a way I have of driving off the
car and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the test;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and bringing up the rear of every cow I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the school, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's dog off—then, I account it high time to get to truck as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all table in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the monkey with me.
